# Data-Visualisation
A series of JS+SQL projects with the goal of learning to visualize data.
Our university generously supplied us with an extensive database encompassing a wealth of data concerning Danish politicians. This comprehensive repository included relevant information about each politician, details about their affiliated party, and a comprehensive collection of their tweets along with associated Twitter accounts.
